Advent of Code 2023
-------------------

This year I've decided to participate to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge as a way to dust off my programming skills. My solutions are not guaranteed to be efficient or minimal; since I'm kinda busy with work and other issues, I'm focusing mainly on "re-accustoming" myself with languages I haven't used in a while, concepts I feel I need some de-rusting on, or to explore new languages. I'll also try to use a different language each day üòä
